## How It Works

The extension uses sophisticated field matching algorithms to identify form fields:

1. **DOM Scanning**: Scans the webpage for input fields, textareas, and select elements
2. **Intelligent Matching**: Uses multiple strategies to match fields:
   - Field names and IDs (exact and partial matches)
   - Label text analysis (associated labels, wrapped labels, adjacent text)
   - Placeholder text matching
   - ARIA label attributes
   - Priority-based scoring system
3. **Smart Filling**: Fills fields while respecting existing content and triggering proper events

### Field Matching Examples

The extension recognizes various naming conventions:

- **Name fields**: `name`, `full_name`, `fullName`, `applicant_name`, `candidate_name`
- **Email fields**: `email`, `email_address`, `contact_email`, `e_mail`
- **Phone fields**: `phone`, `telephone`, `phone_number`, `mobile`, `tel`
- **Address fields**: `address`, `street_address`, `street`, `location`

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All profile data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API
- **No External Servers**: No data is sent to external servers or third parties
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions (storage, activeTab)
- **Open Source**: Full source code is available for review

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Google Chrome
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Testing
1. Load the extension in developer mode
2. Open `test.html` in Chrome
3. Use the extension to fill the test form
4. Verify all fields are filled correctly

### Customization
You can modify the field matching logic in `content.js` by updating the `FIELD_MAPPINGS` object to add new field types or improve matching accuracy.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
- Ensure you're on a webpage with form fields
- Check that the extension has the necessary permissions
- Try refreshing the page and using the extension again

### Fields Not Being Filled
- Verify your profile data is saved (check the Profile tab)
- Some websites use custom form implementations that may not be compatible
- The extension works best with standard HTML form elements

### Can't Save Profile
- Ensure all required fields (marked with *) are filled
- Check that your email address is in a valid format
